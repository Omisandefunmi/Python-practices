Depression as a mood disorder affects a person's ability to perform life activities including academic performance (Hysenbegasi et al, 2005). It is common for people who suffer from depression to engage in self-blame, experience confusion and a feeling of hopelessness. Though depression has a debilitating effects on adults, however it is often worse on young adults who lack the social and emotional experience and support to handle such situations.

The proposed project is a Support chatting app for semicolon students. It will serve as a safe-zone platform where students can express their frustrations, anxiety and mental distress. This is to provide support for students going through different stages of mental distress in their learning journey.
